This project is being used to sharpen and develop my skills at C++ by creating a mini-accelerator control simulator of the LHC at CERN.

Right now is very simple text based output, but here's the future planned additions:

Early Stages:
🚀 1. Add Realistic Control Interfaces (OPC UA)
🖥 2. Implement a GUI (SCADA-style)
🛰 3. Add Multi-threading and Concurrency
🛠 4. Integrate Unit and Integration Testing (CI/CD)

Later Stages:
🗃 5. Logging and Monitoring Framework
⚡ 6. Simulate Fault Conditions and Error Handling
📡 7. Networking and Communication Protocols
📈 8. Data Persistence and Analysis

Wishes for very late:

🧩 9. Docker Containerization
🔐 10. Security and Safety Mechanisms
